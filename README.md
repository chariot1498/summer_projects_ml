# summer_projects_ml
These are some projects that i made during summers 2017

1.Autoencoder using keras

2.Most dominant color extraction from an image and recreating the image from that (done using pca)

3.Applying CNN on mnist dataset. Also using transfer learning on cnn to make training faster for mnist

4.Autoencoder using convolutional NN and visualising their feature maps.

5.Applying CNN on cifar-10 dataset . 

6.Meta heurestic algorithms genetic algo and differential evolution algo.
